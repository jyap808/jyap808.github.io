The Klipper firmware does not need to be upgraded often on the Octopus Pro MCU and LDO Nitehawk-36 toolboard. The only time it was upgraded was when there were deprecation warnings since Klipper is kept up to date.

Here are some notes on upgrading the firmware since I did not use the correct settings when building and flashing the firmware which meant I had to perform additional lower level loading of the correct firmware.

## Octopus Pro settings

Start Klipper firmware configuration:
```
cd ~/klipper
make clean
make menuconfig
```

Select:
* Select `Enable extra low-level configuration options`
* Set the micro-controller architecture to `STMicroelectronics STM32`
* Set the Processor model to `STM32F446`
* Set the Bootloader offset to `32KiB bootloader`
* Set the Clock Reference to `12 MHz crystal`
* Set the Communication interface to `USB (on PA11/PA12)`

Build and flash the firmware:
```
make
sudo service klipper stop
make flash FLASH_DEVICE=/dev/serial/by-id/usb-Klipper_stm32f446xx_19003A000951313133353932-if00
sudo service klipper start
```

## Nitehawk36 settings

Start Klipper firmware configuration:
```
cd ~/klipper
make clean
make menuconfig
```

Select:
* Select `Enable extra low-level configuration options`
* Set the micro-controller architecture to `Raspberry Pi RP2040/RP235x`
* Set the Processor model to `rp3040`
* Set the Bootloader offset to `16KiB bootloader`. Not setting this will erase the Katapult bootloader!
* Set the Communication interface to `USBSERIAL`

Build and flash the firmware:
```
make
sudo service klipper stop
make flash FLASH_DEVICE=/dev/serial/by-id/usb-Klipper_rp2040_313631313202C86C-if00
sudo service klipper start
```
