In newer versions of macOS, the Dockâ€™s auto-hide behavior has become noticeably 
sluggish. Fortunately, you can speed things up using a couple of hidden settings 
via the command line.

## Speed up Dock animation

This removes the animation delay when the Dock appears or disappears:
```
defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier -int 0; killall Dock
```

## Remove the delay before the Dock appears

This makes the Dock show instantly when you hover near the edge:
```
defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -float 0; killall Dock
```

## Revert to default behavior

If you want to undo the changes and go back to the default behavior:
```
defaults delete com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier
defaults delete com.apple.dock autohide-delay
killall Dock
```
