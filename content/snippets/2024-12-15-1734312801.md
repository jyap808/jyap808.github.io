I've noticed that the captive portal often does not show up with Linux when accessing public WiFi.

A captive portal is a web page that pops up when you first access that public WiFi.

The workaround is to access a site which just uses HTTP. In the background, operating systems such as Mac OS hit [http://captive.apple.com](http://captive.apple.com). In my case, I just memorize the URL [neverssl.com](http://neverssl.com).

To manually trigger the captive portal, follow these steps:
* Connect to the Wi-Fi network.
* Open your web browser.
* Navigate to [neverssl.com](http://neverssl.com).
* This should redirect you to the captive portal login page, allowing you to complete the login process and gain internet access.
