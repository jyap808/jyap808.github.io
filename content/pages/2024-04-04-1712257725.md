I have installed Arch Linux on a Microsoft Surface Book 3 to use as my "focus" machine. This page outlines some things I've had to install and tweak.

Most everything [works out of the box](https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface/wiki/Supported-Devices-and-Features#surface-books-and-surface-laptop-studio) except the cameras, which I've disabled in the BIOS. Suspend only supports [ACPI state 0 Suspend-To-Idle](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/power/states.txt) and eats up 20%+ of the battery life overnight, but as of kernel 6.9.9-arch1-1-surface I have not had issues with Hibernation.

This is *not* a recommended laptop for running Linux.

### Visual Studio Code hangs on launch

Had [this issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/188397#issuecomment-2033053045).

Work around add to ~/.vscode-oss/argv.json
```
        "password-store": "basic"
```

### Toshy - Mac key bindings

Installed [Toshy](https://github.com/RedBearAK/toshy) because apparently it works better with Wayland.

Install [xremap-gnome](https://github.com/xremap/xremap-gnome) for this to work on Wayland.

### SSH Agent

Add this to ~/.bashrc

```
# ssh-agent modified from: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/SSH_keys#ssh-agent
if ! pgrep -u "$USER" ssh-agent > /dev/null; then
    ssh-agent > "$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/ssh-agent.env"
fi
if [[ ! -f "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ]]; then
    source "$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/ssh-agent.env" >/dev/null
fi
```

Realized that the timeout is set to 1 hour with the "-t 1h" flag. I removed this since it was annoying.

### Jetbrains Mono, Apple and Microsoft fonts

Arch has this
```
sudo pacman -S ttf-jetbrains-mono apple-fonts ttf-ms-win11-auto
```

Set the default for Visual Studio Code: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59776906/how-do-i-change-vs-code-settings-to-use-jetbrains-mono-font

### Avahi

Install
```
sudo pacman -S avahi nss-mdns
```

Enable and start
```
sudo systemctl enable avahi-daemon.service
sudo systemctl start avahi-daemon.service
```

Enable hostname resolution. Modify line in /etc/nsswitch.conf
```
hosts: mymachines mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] resolve [!UNAVAIL=return] files myhostname dns
```

### Brother HL-3170CDW printer

Install CUPS
```
sudo pacman -S cups
systemctl enable cups.service
systemctl restart cups.service
systemctl status cups.service
```

Install driver
```
yay -S brother-hl3170cdw
```

Add printer via CUPS Administration http://localhost:631/admin

### Hibernate

I set up a large enough swap partition (equal to RAM size) so that extra set up like setting up a swap file offset isn't necessary.

The other steps are to configure the initramfs:
 - Add 'resume'
 - Regenerate initramfs

Specify the kernel parameter `resume=${swap_device}`.

## Unresolved issues

### i915 0000:00:02.0: [drm] *ERROR* Link Training Unsuccessful

dmesg output:
```
[  861.301517] i915 0000:00:02.0: [drm] *ERROR* Link Training Unsuccessful
```

Similar to: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/36392

Appears to be an issue with the dock and using a USBC to Display Port cable.

Unplugging the power cable (which connects to the dock) seems to help get the external screen displaying again. Annoying workaround.

### Resume from Hibernate has the wrong time

Resume from Hibernate suffers from clock drift so has the wrong time.

To resolve this, I set up a systemd service that runs a time synchronization command when the system wakes up. Here's a step-by-step approach to implement this.

First, make sure you have the systemd-timesyncd service enabled and running. This is the default time synchronization daemon for Arch Linux. If it's not already enabled, you can enable it with:
```
sudo systemctl enable --now systemd-timesyncd.service
```

Create a new systemd service file:
```
sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/fix-time-on-resume.service
```

Add the following content to the file:
```
[Unit]
Description=Fix system time on resume from hibernate
After=suspend.target hibernate.target hybrid-sleep.target suspend-then-hibernate.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/bin/systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd.service

[Install]
WantedBy=suspend.target hibernate.target hybrid-sleep.target suspend-then-hibernate.target
```

Reload the systemd daemon to recognize the new service:
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Enable the new service:
```
sudo systemctl enable fix-time-on-resume.service
```

This service automatically restarts the systemd-timesyncd service when your system resumes from hibernation, which corrects the time.
