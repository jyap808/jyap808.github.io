I have installed Arch Linux on a Microsoft Surface Book 3 to use as my "focus" machine. This page outlines some things I've had to install and tweak.

Most everything [works out of the box](https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface/wiki/Supported-Devices-and-Features#surface-books-and-surface-laptop-studio) except the cameras. Suspend (which works inconsistently) also eats up 20%+ of the battery life overnight.

This is *not* a recommended laptop for running Linux.

### Visual Studio Code hangs on launch

Had [this issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/188397#issuecomment-2033053045).

Work around add to ~/.vscode-oss/argv.json
```
        "password-store": "basic"
```

### Toshy - Mac key bindings

Installed [Toshy](https://github.com/RedBearAK/toshy) because apparently it works better with Wayland.

Install [xremap-gnome](https://github.com/xremap/xremap-gnome) for this to work on Wayland.

### SSH Agent

Add this to ~/.bashrc

```
# ssh-agent modified from: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/SSH_keys#ssh-agent
if ! pgrep -u "$USER" ssh-agent > /dev/null; then
    ssh-agent > "$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/ssh-agent.env"
fi
if [[ ! -f "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ]]; then
    source "$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/ssh-agent.env" >/dev/null
fi
```

Realized that the timeout is set to 1 hour with the "-t 1h" flag. I removed this since it was annoying.

### Jetbrains Mono, Apple and Microsoft fonts

Arch has this
```
sudo pacman -S ttf-jetbrains-mono apple-fonts ttf-ms-win11-auto
```

Set the default for Visual Studio Code: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59776906/how-do-i-change-vs-code-settings-to-use-jetbrains-mono-font

### Avahi

Install
```
sudo pacman -S avahi nss-mdns
```

Enable and start
```
sudo systemctl enable avahi-daemon.service
sudo systemctl start avahi-daemon.service
```

Enable hostname resolution. Modify line in /etc/nsswitch.conf
```
hosts: mymachines mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] resolve [!UNAVAIL=return] files myhostname dns
```

### Brother HL-3170CDW printer

Install CUPS
```
sudo pacman -S cups
systemctl enable cups.service
systemctl restart cups.service
systemctl status cups.service
```

Install driver
```
yay -S brother-hl3170cdw
```

Add printer via CUPS Administration http://localhost:631/admin

### Other

```
chromium
code
freetube
git
go
hugo
jq
rust
sudo
vim
```

## Unresolved issues

### i915 0000:00:02.0: [drm] *ERROR* Link Training Unsuccessful

dmesg output:
```
[  861.301517] i915 0000:00:02.0: [drm] *ERROR* Link Training Unsuccessful
```

Similar to: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/36392

Appears to be an issue with the dock and using a USBC to Display Port cable.

.. Switching from Gnome (Wayland) to Gnome Classic (X11) has resolved some annoying suspend issues.

### Suspend is inconsistent
