## Introduction

I have installed Arch Linux on a Lenovo ThinkPad T14 Gen 4 (Intel) "work" machine. This page outlines some setup items and other issues.

## Background

I wanted to get a better laptop for Linux after using it on a poorly supported [Surface Book 3](./2024-04-04-1712257725.md), which was a former work laptop that I obtained for free. The Lenovo ThinkPad T14 Gen 4 (Intel) doesn't have a dedicated Arch Linux page yet, but it does have [Ubuntu certification](https://ubuntu.com/certified/202303-31392), and other online reports gave me confidence that there wouldn't be any issues.

This model of laptop was released in May 2023, with the latest release being the Gen 5. A slightly older generation laptop generally means better compatibility with the latest kernels.

This model has soldered RAM, so I made sure to buy it with 32 GB of RAM, which I anticipate will be sufficient for the near future. There aren't many upgrade/repair options other than changing out the SSD and battery, which was fine for my needs.

In terms of price, I was looking for a cheaper refurbished or open box machine and didn't want to spend over $1000.

Other models I considered:

* Framework 13
  * The amount of hardware configuration options seemed overkill for my needs
  * Difficult to find refurbished
  * Not as established a supplier compared to Lenovo

* Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 11 (December 2022)
  * More expensive due to focus on lightness
  * No replaceable RAM or batteries
  * The lack of a replaceable battery was a dealbreaker

* Lenovo ThinkPad T14S Gen 4 (May 2023)
  * Would have been my preferred model as it's slightly lighter than the T14
  * Doesn't have an ethernet port (which I don't require)
  * Less popular than the T14, so couldn't find any with 32 GB of RAM

* Lenovo ThinkPad T14 Gen 5 (May 2024)
  * Strongly considered this option
  * RAM is replaceable with two DDR5 SO-DIMMs
  * Uses a more repair-friendly design
  * Being the latest generation, cheaper models hadn't yet hit the market
  * According to [a review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEHBvHuBTSM&t=746s), the soldered RAM of the Gen 4 might actually improve battery life
