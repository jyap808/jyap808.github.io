### BTCO - Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF

The [fund holdings page](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/holdings?audienceType=Investor&ticker=BTCO) is blank.

### BTCW - WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund

The [fund web site](https://www.wisdomtree.com/investments/etfs/crypto/btcw) has no Bitcoin holdings information... No, wait, I just found the details.

### FBTC - Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund

The [fund web site](https://digital.fidelity.com/prgw/digital/research/quote/dashboard/summary?symbol=FBTC) has the Bitcoin holdings information.. but you need to click on "Prospectus, holdings & reports" then get "Daily Holdings Report" in Excel format.. It's difficult.
