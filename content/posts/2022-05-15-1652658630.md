I've never liked the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) (being Ruby) that comes with built-in support from GitHub. With the advent of GitHub Actions, this has allowed me to set this site up with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and an auto-deployment.

Definitely not sure what content I want to put up on this site. I've built it and blown it up a few times.

The content creation process has been a long term concern of mine. Namely the whole advertiser-based content platforms we're stuck with. I'm also annoyed by the errosion of attention span that these platforms give us.

In recent years I have also faced the struggle with the interactions with "audience" and other parts like censorship and public image.

Anyway. This is the state of the world. This is the first post.
