This page outlines some things I&amp;rsquo;ve had to install and tweak.

This is not a recommended laptop for running Linux.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin ETF flow bot - Methodology</title><link>https://julianyap.com/pages/2024-03-13-1710370430/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Mar 2024 15:53:50 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://julianyap.com/pages/2024-03-13-1710370430/</guid><description>Introduction My Bitcoin ETF flow bot which posts updates at the X account @ubiqetfbot works by scraping the associated web sites of the ETFs to gather the updated reported Bitcoin holdings in the respective fund/trust.

At some point they introduced the v2 API but the functionality isn&amp;rsquo;t complete.
The v1 API needs to be used for uploading media and getting the resulting media ID. We then need to use the v2 API to reference the uploaded media ID to finalize the post.
